     <h3 class="bio">Biography</h3>

<p>An English actor Richard Crispin Armitage is famous for his roles as John Thornton in North and South, Guy of Gisborne in Robin Hood, and Lucas North in Spooks.</p>

<p>His first major television role was the role of John  Standring in the BBC drama Sparkhous (2002). After this he took a variety supporting roles in the TV productions of Between the Sheets, Cold Feet (series 5), and Ultimate Force (Series 2).</p>

<p>In 2004, he appeared in his first leading role, as John Thornton in the BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South. Armitage said that he felt personally drawn to the role. </p>

<p>In 2005, he played Peter MacDuff in Macbeth in the BBC's Shakespeare -Told series and appeared in one episode of Inspector Lynley Mysteries called "In Divine Proportion" as a recovering gambling addict, Phillip Turner. Richard also starred in The Impressionists, playing the young Claude Monet and as Dr Alec Track in ITV's The Golden Hour, a medical series based on the London Air Ambulance. He also played his first substantial role in movies with the independent film Frozen.</p>

<p>In 2006, Armitage took on the major role of Guy of Gisborne in the BBC series Robin Hood. The third and final series of Robin Hood started on 28 March 2009.</p>

<p>Armitage appeared in a two-part 2006 Christmas special of The Vicar of Dibley, as Harry Kennedy – the vicar's new love interest (and eventual husband). He reprised the role in 2007 for Red Nose Day. On 8 April 2007, he starred in George Gently, a detective drama, with Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby. Armitage played biker Ricky Deeming. On 9 May 2007, he appeared in the BBC Four production of Miss Marie Lloyd - Queen of The Music Hall playing Marie Lloyd's first husband, Percy Courtenay. He also appeared in the Granada TV production of Agatha Christie's novel Ordeal by Innocence as the character Philip Durrant.</p>

<p>Armitage joined the cast of Spooks for series 7 which began on 27 October 2008, in the UK, as the character Lucas North.  Armitage said about the character: “On the surface Lucas is an amiable character but eight years in a Russian prison has had a profound effect on him. His personality is divided between who he was before he was imprisoned, the prisoner, and the person he has become. He has an outer facade which is personable, but underneath is someone who has been through a big trauma... He has no knowledge of how damaged he is emotionally until memories start to work their way to the surface”.</p>

<p>In March 2009, he began filming for Series 8 of Spooks, which began airing in November 2009. In July 2010 he finished filming series 9, which began airing in late September 2010. His real name was revealed in episode 7 as John Bateman. Bateman had murdered the real Lucas North shortly before North's admission to MI5, and had taken his place. Series 9 ended in a confrontation with Harry Pearce on the roof of the Enver Tower, from which Bateman/North leapt to his death.</p>

<p>On 20 May 2009, Armitage appeared in the BBC1 drama Moving On as John Mulligan. </p>

<p>In May 2010 he starred as John Porter in Strike Back for Sky 1.  Sky1 commissioned a second series of Strike Back, which began broadcasting in August 2011. However, because of his commitments to filming The Hobbit Armitage only appears as a guest star in the second series. </p>

<p>Armitage appeared as Nazi spy Heinz Kruger in the Captain America: The First Avenger film, released in July 2011. He gave even this small role his full commitment to realizing the character. </p>

<p>He has also been cast as Thorin Oakenshield for the upcoming production of The Hobbit, the 1st film of which is scheduled for release in December 2012. When asked about playing the iconic character, Armitage was really amazed to play a character from a book that he was brought to as a child.</p>

<p>In recent years, Armitage has also performed a great deal of voice work, such as reading poetry for various radio programmes and starring as Robert Lovelace in BBC Radio 4's production of Clarissa: A History of a Young Lady in April 2010. He has recorded six audio books based on BBC's "Robin Hood" as well as Bernard Cornwel's The Lords of the North and three Georgette Heyer novels for Naxos AudioBooks: Sylvester, or the Wicked Uncle, Venetia, and The Convenient Marriage which was released in August 2010. He has also narrated many documentaries such as "Homes From Hell", "Empire's Children", "Too Poor for Posh School?", "Forest Elephants: Rumble in the Jungle" and others.</p>
